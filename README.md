# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
```
###Step1 : Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation
###Step 2: Prepare the lists from each equations and assign in np.array()
###Step 3: Using the np.linalg.inv(), we can find the inverse of the given matrix
##Step 4: End the program
```
